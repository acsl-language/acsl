\chapter*{Foreword}
\thispagestyle{plain}

This document describes version \version{} of the ANSI/ISO \lang
Specification Language (\NAME).
The language features may still evolve in the future. 
In particular, some features in this document
are considered \emph{experimental}, meaning that their syntax and
semantics is not yet fixed.  
These features are marked with
\experimental.  
They must also be considered advanced features,
which are not needed for basic use of this
specification language.
